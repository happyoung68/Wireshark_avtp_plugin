# Wireshark_avtp_plugin
## Introduction
- This is a plugin for the AVTP Protocol in Wireshark, also you can modify it and using for other protocals(e.g., tcp, some/ip and so on)  

- If you want to learn more about building plugins in Wireshark, I recommend reading ***[Mika's tech blog](https://mika-s.github.io/wireshark/lua/dissector/2017/11/04/creating-a-wireshark-dissector-in-lua-1.html)***. As far as I know, it is the best tutorial available.  

- And this code is built to be ***more flexible and easier to use***.ðŸ¥°

- The following is a sample screenshot.
